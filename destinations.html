              <h3 class="history-heading2">Glumarg</h3>Gulmarg is rolling green meadows carpeted by bushes of wild flowers blending into snow-clad mountains, whose peaks peep into the clouds, and mountain streams rushing by, Gulmarg is sheer poetry in nature. While this is the summer landscape of this tiny hamlet in Jammu and Kashmir, in winter, it is transformed into a white wonderland, with skiers making a beeline for its famous slopes. The scenic valley of Gulmarg is a little piece of paradise cocooned by the mighty snow-clad mountains of the Pir Panjal range. Emerald green meadows, deep ravines and pine-forested hills make this meadow of flowers (the meaning of Gulmarg) an ethereal sight that has inspired poets and artists for centuries.
Located only 52 km from Srinagar, Gulmarg sits at an altitude of 2,730 m above sea level, and gets completely covered in snow during winter. This makes it a hub of winter adventure sports like snowboarding, heli-skiing (skiing down a mountain after being taken up by a helicopter), off-piste skiing (skiing on unconventional ski runs) etc. Its slopes have been declared as the 7th best for skiing in Asia.
Gulmarg lies in the lap of the towering Apharwat peak, which is accessible via the Gulmarg Gondola – the second highest cable car ride in the world. A ride on this gondola is a unique experience as it glides above hills and valleys and seems to gets lost in mist and clouds!
Gulmarg had once been a vacation spot for royalty and aristocracy. It is said that Sultan Yousuf Shah, who ruled Kashmir in 1579-1586 AD, was the first to have spotted this valley. And inspired by its rolling grassy slopes emblazoned with wild flowers, named it Gulmarg. It was also a favourite of Mughal emperor Jehangir. Skiing arrived in Gulmarg in 1927, when the British established the Ski Club of India

            <h3 class="history-heading2">Mughal gardens</h3>
            <p class="history-para">“If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this.” -Jahangir, the Mughal Emperor
              Originally called the Farah Bakhsh or ‘Delightful Garden’, the Shalimar Bagh is known as one of the finest foundation by the Mughals. The Shalimar Bagh is located in Srinagar, by the Dal Lake. With its four terraces, the bagh includes a number of fountains, shaded trees and innumerable varieties of flowers that blossom in spring and autumn. The best best views of the garden’s beauty are afforded during Autumn and Spring seasons, when leaves change their colour and the flowers blossom respectively. One can also enjoy a sound and light show (Son Et Lumeiere) in the evening, organised daily during the tourist season, i.e. May to October.

              <h3 class="history-heading2">Leh Ladakh</h3>
              <p class="history-para">A surreal landscape surrounded by the sky-piercing peaks of the snow-capped Himalayan, Zanskar and Karakoram ranges, and adorned with crystal waters of the Shyok, Zanskar and Indus rivers, Leh, in Jammu and Kashmir, is the main city in the Ladakh region, one of the coldest deserts in the world. Perched at a height of over 11,000 ft above sea level, the city of Leh is a haven of adventure sports. Its rugged terrain and gushing rivers provide ripe opportunities for activities like trekking, river rafting, camping, mountain climbing and biking. As the winter months approach, the city is enveloped in a blanket of snow, making it a paradisiacal setting for winter sports. The renowned Chadar Trek starts from the village of Chilling, 66 km away, and mostly covers the frozen area of River Zanskar. Throughout the adventure, trekkers are walking on precarious icy formations, staying in caves filled with stalactites and stalagmites and encountering other snowy landscape.
                Leh is surrounded by three gorgeous high-altitude lakes, Tso Moriri, Tso Kar and Pangong Tso that look like sapphires embedded in the ground. A natural wonder that leaves tourists in awe is the Magnetic Hill on the outskirts of the city. It is said to defy gravity as it tends to pull vehicles upwards. Leh is a prominent Buddhist centre and is dotted with several important monasteries. Tourists can set on a monastery trail and admire the ancient cultures of the region come alive in various paintings adorning the walls while indulging in meditation and other therapeutic and spiritual activities.
                Leh was the erstwhile capital of the kingdom of Ladakh and boasts a legacy that is reflective of its rich history. With the 17th-century Leh Palace at its heart, which is a great example of medieval Tibetan architecture, the city enjoys a smattering of heritage sites that stand tall to this day. One of the best ways to experience the culture of Leh is to check into a homestay where the host will leave no stone unturned in immersing guests in Ladakhi culture. Another great way to “taste” the region is by way of its fresh produce: apricots, apples, and other fruits and vegetables that can be found in its orchards and markets.
